<div class="past_meeting">This meeting has now taken place. Unfortunately, due to technical constraints, no audio or video was taken.</div>

**Please [sign up on Upcoming](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/6590109/) if you will be attending.**

An opportunity to learn and share knowledge and stories about how you use Python, how you'd like to use it, cool features of the language, open source projects you've used, deployment, war stories, philosophy, [Zen](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/), or anything remotely related to Python.

Each talk will last approximately 5-15 minutes. They can be as structured or unstructured as you like - slides are optional. **If you'd like to speak, please [drop me a quick email](mailto:jamie.matthews@gmail.com) with your name and a very brief description of your topic**, and I'll add you to the list. 

It would be nice to get as many speakers as we can. The event is intended to be fun and informal, so don't worry if you've never talked at an event before. Just turn up and enjoy yourself!

### Talks ###

This list is incomplete, and will be expanded before the day!

#### Adam Collard - IPython ####

[IPython](http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/) is an interactive shell for the Python programming language that offers enhanced introspection, additional shell syntax, code highlighting, tab completion, string completion, and rich history.

#### Gemma Hentsch - Django ####

Gemma will talk about the anatomy of a simple [Django](http://djangoproject.com) app. She'll cover the model file, the views, forms, templates and the urls file in a very light and simple way, to give a rough idea of where to start with developing more sophisticated practical Django applications.

#### Jamie Matthews - the Flask web framework ####

[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a fun but powerful 'microframework' which allows you to develop small-to-medium-sized apps very quickly using a tiny amount of code. It's used to power the [BrightonPy website](http://brightonpy.org).

#### Ian Ozsvald - Artificial Intelligence with Python ####

Ian will demo Headroid3 with face tracking and Arduinos using pySerial and (py)OpenCV, show the tiny guts of bottle.py behind [http://ocr.aicookbook.com/](http://ocr.aicookbook.com/) and briefly return to his last pyCUDA talk with a demo of a pure Python CUDA-ised implementation of the Mandelbrot set (fast math is only a few lines of Python away - this didn't exist for the last talk).

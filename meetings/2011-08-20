**Please [sign up on Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2011/brightonpy-hack-day/) if you will be attending.**

On a summer's Saturday at the Skiff, BrightonPy members will be meeting up to work on a fun project together. We going to be collaborating on a relatively simple web application, built with [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com), which we think will be useful to other groups like BrightonPy all over the world.

If you'd like to help in any way, for any amount of time, please do come along. Whether you're a Django expert or a curious beginner, or even if you don't know anything about Python, you'll still be more than welcome. We can help each other learn, and we can all contribute in other ways: visual design, user experience, HTML + CSS + JavaScript, project management or tea-making. There'll be beer if you want it, and we'll all chip in for snacks, pizza etc. Any when we're finished, we'll probably head to the pub.

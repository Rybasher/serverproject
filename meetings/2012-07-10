**Please [sign up on Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2012/brightonpy-julython/) if you will be attending.**

[Julython](http://www.julython.org) is an opportunity for Python programmers around the world to work on pet projects in their spare time throughout the month of July. BrightonPy tonight will be an informal meeting: bring your laptop, help yourself to drinks and nibbles, and take the chance to:

* Work on one of your own open source projects
* Find other developers to collaborate with on something new
* Play with some new technology you've been meaning to get to grips with
* Show off an idea or technology you're excited about
* Meet other Python developers and get some ideas for where to go next
* Impromptu code review
* Have a beer with some other geeks

If you're not sure what to work on, we still have our Hack Day project from last summer, [usrgrp](https://github.com/usrgrp/usrgrp/) to get finished!

**NOTE: This meeting is on a Monday (rather than our usual Tuesday) to avoid clashing with Valentine's Day.**

Another opportunity to learn and share knowledge and stories about how you use Python, how you'd like to use it, cool features of the language, open source projects you've used, deployment, war stories, philosophy, Zen, or anything remotely related to Python.

Another opportunity to learn and share knowledge and stories about how you use Python, how you'd like to use it, cool features of the language, open source projects you've used, deployment, war stories, philosophy, Zen, or anything remotely related to Python.

If you'd like to present something (or just chair a discussion), that would be fantastic. Otherwise, just turn up and listen!

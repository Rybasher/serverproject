A foray into two emerging technologies that have made a big difference to the way we write Python at [Epio](http://ep.io/) - [Eventlet](http://eventlet.net/), an asynchronous concurrency framework, and [ZeroMQ](http://www.zeromq.org/), a network message protocol with more features than you can shake a stick at.

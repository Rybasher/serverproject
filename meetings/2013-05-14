In this talk, we'll go over [Cython](http://www.cython.org), a language/compiler designed to make writing Python C-extensions as easy as writing Python itself.  We'll see how we can use Cython's optional static typing to write much more efficient code than could be done in Python itself.  Additionally, we'll take a look at how Cython can be used to interface with external C / C++ libraries.  If there is time, we can also take a look at how Cython efficiently works with Numpy arrays.

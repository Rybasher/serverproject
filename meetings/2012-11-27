**IMPORTANT NOTE: This meeting is *not* at our usual venue. It's at the BuildBrighton Hackspace, just off Hollingdean Road. Please see the "[How To Find Us](http://www.buildbrighton.com/blog/contact/how-to-find-us/)" page on the BuildBrighton site for directions.**

For this event, we've teamed up with Brighton's Raspberry Pi User Group for a special "Py/Pi" event. Just in case you've never heard of it, the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) is a credit-card sized computer that costs just £25, and can be used for all manner of low-cost, low-power, high-fun projects.

Jamie Matthews will be giving an introduction to the Python programming language, which comes pre-installed on the official Raspberry Pi operating system distributions.  Jamie will take us through the fundamentals of the language, showing just why Python is becoming *the* language of choice for projects of all sizes, and why it's particularly well-suited to the Raspberry Pi.

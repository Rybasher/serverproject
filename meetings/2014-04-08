*A joint event with Big Data Brighton*

**Please note that this event is *NOT* at our usual venue. Instead, it is at The Fusebox, New England House. It's also at 6pm rather than our usual time of 7pm. See the Big Data Brighton meetup group page [here](http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Brighton/events/171246332/) for full details, and to RSVP.**

What does 'city data' tell us about the people, systems and environment around us? What data sources can be used to model a city?

Guest speaker David King, Software Developer at Oxford University, will talk through a project he is leading to build an API platform for use in application development - both within the University and beyond. What are the benefits of this approach to application development, and how can it be used to improve the city?

From a mobile app that provides live transport updates on bus routes and car park spaces, to a searchable book index of university libraries, the 'Oxford API' is a pioneering open-data project.

Following David's talk, we will be discussing a project to build a city-wide data platform here in Brighton.

*Again, this meeting is **NOT** at The Skiff. [Please click here to RSVP](http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Brighton/events/171246332/).*

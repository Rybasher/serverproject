Happy new Year everyone! And what better way to start 2018 with a talk from [Airfinity's](https://www.airfinity.com) Lead Engineer, James Heywood ([@jdheywood](https://twitter.com/jdheywood)).

James will be talking about the use of ORMs and Databases as Code with examples of ORM usage, generating and using migrations 
and what do you when your dev team runs wild and forks the migration path.

Looking forward to seeing you all here & get your questions ready

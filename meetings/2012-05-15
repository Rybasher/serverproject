This month we have a joint event with Functional Brighton and shall look at functional programming as it applies to Python programming!

A rough idea of topics we'll cover includes:

* An introduction to functional programming - what is it? how is it different? why is it interesting?
* Functional patterns in Python - how are common functional idioms expressed in Python
* Use cases for functional approaches in Python

It should be good `fun()` !

Please sign up on [Functional Brighton's Meetup Page](http://www.meetup.com/Functional-Brighton/events/63895532/) if you'll be attending.

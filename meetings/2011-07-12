This will be a 30 minute summary of Ian's EuroPython tutorial aimed at making CPU-bound tasks run faster on Python. The talk will start by looking at several profiling techniques (equally useful for web-based and I/O bound tasks too!) and then move on to C compilation (Cython, ShedSkin), multiprocessing and multi-computer processing with a quick look at CUDA-based processing and PyPy at the end. The goal will be to show you a number of techniques to make CPU-bound processes run faster on 1 or many machines.

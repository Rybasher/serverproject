Kicking off the Brighton Python meet up again with a number of different speakers covering subjects of 
Airflow to the MicroPython framework.

Come along, listen to the talks, eat some Pizza & catch up with old friends and new. Feel free to bring along
anyone else you feel would enjoy it and if you have a topic you want to speak about we've got time so we can 
get you in front of everyone.

Whilst the venue will be open from 6pm, we'll use the first hour to eat, drink and socialise so we can give
those who are coming from further afield a chance to turn up without missing out on the fun.

Looking forward to seeing you all there

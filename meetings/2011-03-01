We haven't had a proper BrightonPy meeting for a while, so we decided it's high time for a few drinks and a chat about Python. Bring along ideas for future talks you'd like to see or present, projects to show off or suggest, bits of code to discuss, or just some money for a beer.

Meet at [The Florist](http://hereit.is/theflorist) on Upper North Street, Brighton at 7.30pm.

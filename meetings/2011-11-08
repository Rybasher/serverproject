The idea behind [The Larch Environment](https://sites.google.com/site/larchenv/) is to make programming more visual. We do this by representing objects visually, rather than as text, as seen in a normal Python console. An active document system mixes rich text with running code, and interactive objects to create live Python programs, with a fast edit-debug cycle. We also allow the use of visual content within source code, providing facilities for visually expanding the Python language, and providing LISP/Smalltalk style functionality within Python.

After being pushed back a view months due to availabily problems, the next BrightonPy event is here!

Join us at Platf9rm, Floor 6 where Airfinity's Senior Data Scientist; Ewa Kabzinska, will be talking to the metaphorical stage to talk to us about the analysis of social and non-social networks.

Network analysis has been around for many years now and itâ€™s been applied to various problems, from advertising to criminology. There is a range of tools for network analysis, including several Python libraries. Ewa will talk through the general idea of network analysis, show some examples of real life applications and share her views on how to best work with networks in Python.

PHP is considered by many to be the de facto language of the web. But why do people keep talking about Django? This talk will explore some of the basic differences between PHP and Python, compare how they work on the web, and explain why you might choose one set of technologies over the other. It will also give a rough introduction to Django aimed at PHP developers particularly, but accessible to a general audience.

Jamie has been using both Python and PHP (amongst other things) for almost eight years, on and off. After working full-time as a PHP developer for the last three years, he has recently jumped ship and co-founded a company building web applications with Python and Django.
